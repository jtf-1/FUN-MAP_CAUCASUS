Range Control: 250.000

Ranges are script scored and have an F10 menu system you can use to manage them.

Bomb targets are scored on the proximity of the last round to the target. Smoke will be used to mark the round's impact.

Strafe Pits, where available, are configured with two targets. Aircraft must be below 3000ft AGL and within 500ft either side of the inbound heading to the target to avoid a foul pass. Rounds fired after the foul line will not count.
